Use Bundles to save State in Android

In this practice you will be creating a simple app that has an EditText for your name with a Button to submit it. When you press the button, it prints out the following message in a TextView below "Hello NAME! You will be saved into the bundle! X names have been saved." X is a counter for the number of times the button has been clicked. In the starter code, load the project HelloNameSaveState.
